The Environment:
----------------
The shell maintains a set of information during a shell session,known as the environment.
It's just a key-value pairs that define properties like:
- your home directory
- your working directory
- The name of your shell
- The name of the logged in user

Viewing the Environment:
-----------------------
printenv
use the printenv command to view the environment variables and their current values.


Parameter Expansion
-------------------
echo User
USER

echo $USER
aashika
 variable prefixed with a dollar sign($), the shell will replace it with the actual value

Defining variables
------------------
To define a variable,use the 
syntax : variable=value

Built-in variables are upper-cased, so its a commom convention to lowercase custom variables to prevent confusion


1. Shell Variables
-----------------------
   Shell variables are local to the current shell session.
   They are created and used only in that shell — they do not get passed to other programs or subshells.
   As soon as you close the terminal, they are gone.

  Example:
       name="Aashika"
       echo $name
  Output:
      Aashika


Now open a new terminal or subshell:

echo $name
output: (nothing)
Because name is a shell variable, it was not inherited by the new shell.

2. Environment Variables
--------------------------
   Environment variables are global variables.
   They are inherited by child processes (programs, subshells, scripts).
   Typically used to configure system behavior, like $PATH, $HOME, $USER, etc.
 Example:
     export name="Aashika"
     echo $name


Now open a subshell:
echo $name
Output:
Aashika


View all shell variables:
------------------------
set

View only environment variables:
------------------------------
printenv
 or
env
5. Permanent Environment Variables
----------------------------------
If you want a variable to persist every time you open a terminal:

Add it to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile:
export name="Aashika"
Then reload:
source ~/.bashrc

Startup File
-------------
What is PS1?

PS1 stands for Prompt String 1.
It defines how your shell prompt looks — that text you see before you type a command in the terminal.
Example:
When you open your terminal, you might see:
aashika@ubuntu:~$
Here, the part aashika@ubuntu:~$ is your prompt, and it’s controlled by the variable PS1.
1.View your current prompt format
  echo $PS1

Startup files are configuration scripts that the shell (like Bash) automatically reads and executes when a session starts.
They set up your environment — variables, aliases, prompt styles, and paths.

Types of Shell Sessions
------------------------
Type	                           Description	                                                     Example
Login shell	              You log in through a console, SSH, or 
                          terminal that asks for a username/password.	                 Logging into system or using ssh user@host
Non-login shell	          A new shell opened inside an existing session.	             Opening a new terminal window or running bash manually

Startup Files for Login Shells
------------------------------
When you log in, Bash reads these files in order:

/etc/profile → System-wide configuration (for all users)

~/.bash_profile → User-specific

~/.bash_login → Used if .bash_profile doesn’t exist

~/.profile → Used if neither of the above exists

 Usually, only one of the user files (.bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile) is used.

 Customizing the prompt:
 -----------------------
 for easy bash PS1 generator : Flogisoft.com , ezprompt.net
 Step 1: Open your .bashrc file
       nano ~/.bashrc

Step 2: Add a colorful prompt (PS1)

Step 3: Save and apply
       After adding your preferred line:
       Press Ctrl + O → save
       Press Enter → confirm
       Press Ctrl + X → exit

step 4: source ~/.bashrc

aliases
-------
We can definr our commands using the alias keyword
alias ll='ls-al'
in the example to the right,we are defining an alias called ll
which is equivalent to running ls-al.
To execute it, we would simply run ll

Verbose literally means “talkative” or “detailed.”
In Linux commands, when you use a verbose option (usually -v),
 it makes the command show more information about what it’s doing.

alias cp='cp -vi'
cp file1.txt file2.txt
'file1.txt' -> 'file2.txt'
If file2.txt already exists:
cp: overwrite 'file2.txt'? y

-i
interactive
Asks before performing an action
alias rm='rm -i'


To see all your active aliases
alias

If you just want to remove it for this session only:
unalias alias_name

To remove all aliases at once:
unalias -a

To remove it permanently
-------------------------
Aliases that are set in .bashrc (or sometimes .bash_profile) will come back each time you open a new terminal —
so you need to delete them from the file too.

Steps:
Open the file:
nano ~/.bashrc

Look for the alias line, like:
alias ll='ls -l'
alias cls='clear'

Delete or comment (#) the line(s).
Example:
# alias ll='ls -l'
Save and exit (Ctrl + O, Enter, Ctrl + X).

Apply changes:
source ~/.bashrc
