The Basic Steps:
----------------
1.Write a script in a file and save it
2.Make the script executable using chmod
3.Verify that the shell can find your script
                                          -------------
The first line of our script should read | #!/bin/bash |
                                          -------------

#! is called the shebang, it’s used to tell the OS which interpreter
it should use when parsing this file.

We want ours to say "use bash to interpret this file!"
eg:
nano hi
#!/bin/bash
# this is first script
echo "hello there $USER"
echo "today is $(date)"
save and exit

run- bash hi

path variable
-------------
It's list of directories.
It is ordered.

scripting - its says command not found
from anywhere (that’s where the two steps come in).
bash scripting -it works

1 — Make your script executable
Right now, it only works with bash scripting because it doesn’t have execute permission.

Let’s fix that 

chmod +x ~/bin/scripting
ls -l ~/bin
-rwxr-xr-x 1 aashika aashika  75 Nov 11 15:50 scripting
The x means it’s executable now.

2 — Add ~/bin to your PATH
Now, let’s make the system recognize anything in your ~/bin folder as a command.

Check if it’s already in PATH:
echo $PATH
If you don’t see /home/aashika/bin (or ~/bin) in that list, add it with this command:
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
Then reload your configuration:
source ~/.bashrc

3 — Test it!
Now from anywhere (like your home directory), just type:
scripting
You should see:
Hello there, aashika
Today is Tue Nov 11 15:50:11 IST 2025
 — your script is now a global command!
