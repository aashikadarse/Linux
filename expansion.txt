Wildcard Characters (aka globbing patterns)
----------------------------------------------
-we can use special wildcard characters to build patterns that can match multiple filenames at once

* -- character represents zero or more characters in a filename.

-ls *.html : will match any files that end with 
            .html like index.html and  navbar.html

-cat blue* : will match any files that start with "blue" like
             "blue.html" or "bluesteel.js"

eg: ls - *at*
--------------------------cat.js
--------------------------data.txt

? -- character represents any single character

-Is app.?? -- will match any files name app that end with 
              two character file extensions like app.js or app.py but not app.css

-Is pic?.png --will match pic1.png,pic2.png,pic3.png, but also picA.png or picx.png

Range Wildcards
----------------
Inside of square brackets [] we can specify a range of characters to match

-Is pic[123].png will only match pic1.png, pic2.png and pic3.png

-Is file[0-9] will match file1,file2....9 

-Is [A-F]* will match any files that begin with a capital 
           A,B,C,D,E or F 

Negating Ranges 
---------------
Inside of square brackets we can specify a range of characters to not match
using a caret (^)

-Is[^a]* will match any files that do NOT start with "a"

Is[^0-9]* will match any files that do NOT start with a 
         numeric digit (0-9)

~Tilde expansion
----------------
eg: echo ~
   /home/kitty 

   user path

Brace expansion
---------------
It is used to generate arbitary strings.
Basically it will generate multiple strings for us based on a pattern .
we provide a set of strings inside of curly baces {}

eg:touch page{1,2,3}.txt -- will generate three new files .
    page1.txt
    page2.txt
    page3.txt 
  
  {a..b} works with only two dots
echo page{1..7}
page1 page2 page3 page4 page5 page6 page7 
---------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir -p: make directory and its parents if needed.

mkdir -p {Mon,Tue,Wed}/{breakfast,lunch,dinner}
Braces expansion part:

The shell (bash) expands the {} part before running mkdir.

{Mon,Tue,Wed} expands to → Mon, Tue, Wed

{breakfast,lunch,dinner} expands to → breakfast, lunch, dinner

When combined with /, bash creates every possible combination like this:

Mon/breakfast
Mon/lunch
Mon/dinner
Tue/breakfast
Tue/lunch
Tue/dinner
Wed/breakfast
Wed/lunch
Wed/dinner


So 3 × 3 = 9 total directories 

 The -p option:

Ensures that if parent directories (Mon, Tue, Wed) do not exist, they are created automatically.

Prevents errors if directories already exist.

 Final result:

After running the command, your directory tree looks like this:

Mon/
├── breakfast/
├── lunch/
└── dinner/

Tue/
├── breakfast/
├── lunch/
└── dinner/

Wed/
├── breakfast/
├── lunch/
└── dinner/

Nested Brace Expansion 
----------------------
echo{x,y{1..5},z}
x y1 y2 y3 y4 y5 z

Arithemetic Expansion
---------------------
syntax:$((expression))
Inside the parantheses we can right arithmetic expressions using:
+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ division
** exponentiation
%modulo

eg: echo $((1+2)) - 3

Quoting
-------
' ' : single quotes Literal text no expansion
" " : double quotes Expandable text( variables + commands work)

echo 'This is $USER' - This is $USER

echo "This is $USER"- This is aashika
 
command substitution
--------------------

we can use the $(command) syntax to display the output of another command.

eg:echo "today is $(date)" - today is Thu 01 May 03:10:31 PM IST

other syntax is : ` `

eg: echo today is `date`
