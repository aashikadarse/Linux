Pipes :
-----------
 Are used to redirect a stream from one program to another program .
 We can take the output of one command and redirect it to the input of another.
                     command -->
                   /    2
             Pipe / 
            /
           /
 --> command
       1

Syntax:
-------
we use pipe character | to seperate commands
     command 1 | command 2
  the output of the first command will be passed to the standard input of the second command

  eg: date |rev
     ls /usr/bin -1 | wc -l 

  > vs | 
  -------
   though both the characters are used to redirect output they do it in very different ways
   > connects a command to some file
   | connects a command to another command
  
  tr - transaltes  the text with an argument
  ---
  eg: msg.txt - she sells shells by the seashore
  cat msg | tr s S -- tr works as cat and then replaces s with S
  She SellS ShellS by the SeaShore
   
   cat msg | tr a-z A -Z --replaces the lower to upper case
   SHE SELLS SHELLS BY THE SeaShore

   cat msg |tr -d s delete s from the file
   he ell hells by the eahore
   
   working with multiple files
   ---------------------------
   tac | rev 
   ----------
   tac file.txt |rev

   first line          third line            enil driht
   second line  --->   second line  --->     enil dnoces
   third line          first line            enil tsrif 

   we are calling tac with a file and then piping the output to rev .
   The final result is the content of file.txt printed "horizontally"
   and "vertically" reversed

   cat | head | tail
   ------------------
   eg: cat file | head -7 | tail -5

   ls | sort | head 
   ----------------
   eg:ls-lh | sort -rhk 5 | head -3
   
   This example display the 3 largest files in the current directory, using ls,sort,and head

   ls -lh → Lists files in long format with human-readable sizes (e.g., 2K, 3M, 1G).
   → Shows file details like permissions, size, date, and name.

   sort -rhk 5 →

   -k 5 → Sorts by the 5th column (the file size column).

   -h → Understands human-readable size units (K, M, G).

   -r → Sorts in reverse order (largest → smallest).

   head -3 → Displays only the top 3 results, i.e., the 3 largest files.

   for finding the 3 files that occupy large space
   du -ah 
   du (Disk Usage) →
   Shows how much disk space is being used by files and directories.

   -h (human-readable) →
   Displays sizes in an easier-to-read format (e.g., KB, MB, GB) instead of raw bytes.

   -a (all) →
   Includes both files and directories (by default, du shows only directory sizes).

tee command
-----------
The tee command reads standard input and copies it both to standard output and to a file.
This allows us to capture information part of the way through a pipeline without 
interrupting the flow.
command 1 | tee filename | command 2

eg: cat colors.txt words.txt | tee colorsandwords.txt | wc
