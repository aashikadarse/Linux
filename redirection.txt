Redirecting the standard output:
--------------------------------
 the redirect output symbol(>)
 tells the shell to redirect the output of a command to a specific file instead of the screen 
 command > filename
 date > output.txt - the date command will print the current date to the screen
                     if we instead run this the output will be redirected to a file called output.txt

  sort -k5n list.txt > sorted_list.txt                    

Appending :
-----------
 when we redirect output into a file using > any existing contents in the file are overwritten 
 to instead keep the existing contents in the file and add new content to the end of the file 
 use >> when redirecting

 date >> cal.txt

 echo meow >>cat.txt

 Redirecting input:
 ------------------
 To pass the contents of a file to standard input,use the <
 symbol followed by the filename
 command < filename

eg: cat<chicken.txt

Redirecting standard input and output together
-----------------------------------------------
we can redirect standard input and output at the same time .
 eg: cat < original.txt > output.txt
    here cat reads the contents of a original.txt and then redirecting the output 
    to a file called output.txt

 eg:sort < names.txt > sorted.txt
   here we are redirecting the names.txt file to the sort command.we are also reidrecting the 
   output of sort to a file called sorted.txt

Redirecting standard error :
----------------------------
By default error messages are output to the screnn ,but we can change this by redirecting standard error
the standard error redirection operator is 2>
eg: cat nonexistenfile 2>error.txt


why 2> /
each stream gets its own numeric file descriptor and for standard error the number is 2
                                      standard
                                      output(1)
                                    /
standard input(0)  ----> command   /
                                   \
                                    \
                                      standard error(2)

all together now 
----------------
eg: cat bees.txt ants.txt >insects.txt 2>error.txt
    here we are concatenating two files,redirecting standard output to a file called
    insects.txt and redirecting standard error to a file called error.txt

Redirecting standard output and error to the same file 
eg:ls docs >output.txt 2>output.txt

           or

  we could instead use 2>&1 which is a fancy sytax for saying "redirect standard error to the same location as standard output
  ls docs > output.txt 2>&1

  newer versions of bash --
   for redirecting both standard output and standard error to the same file 
   &>
   eg:ls docs &> output.txt
      ls docs &>> output.txt
