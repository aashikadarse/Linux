# Deleting, Moving & Copying Exercise

## Part 1: Creating The Folders & Files

Before we can delete, move, or copy things...we need things! It's time to get some more practice using `touch` and `mkdir`

Please create a new directory somewhere on your machine called `Bootcamp`.  Inside of it, create the the folders and files indicated below:

```bash
**Bootcamp/**
	**FallCohort/**
		Italo.txt
		Edgar.txt
		Linus.txt
		Sara.txt 
		Silvio.txt
		**Waitlist/**
			Hanna.txt
			Haris.txt
			Netta.txt
	**WinterCohort/**
		Santiago.txt
		Iris.txt
		Naomi.txt
```
mkdir Bootcamp
cd Bootcamp

mkdir FallCohort
cd FallCohort 
touch Italo.tx Edgar.txt Linus.txt Sara.txt Silvio.txt

mkdir Waitlist
cd Waitlist
touch Hanna.txt Haris.txt Netta.txt

cd ../../
mkdir WinterCohort
touch Santiago.txt Iris.txt Naomi.txt




1. Sadly `Edgar` had to drop out of the course.  Delete the `Edgar.txt` file in `FallCohort`
  rm FallCohort/Edgar.txt
 
2. This means we now have space in our Fall Cohort to move someone off of the waitlist. 
 Please move `Netta.txt` from the `Waitlist` folder into the `FallCohort` folder.
   mv Netta.txt../

3. Please delete the `Waitlist` folder and its contents
   rm -r FallCohort/Waitlist

4.It turns out that I misspelled Sara.  She spells her name "Sarah" with an "h" at the end.  
 Please rename the `Sara.txt` file to `Sarah.txt`
   mv Sara.txt Sarah.txt

5.Unfortunately Italo is having a bit of a personal emergency,
 and he would like to move to our WinterCohort.  Please move the `Italo.txt` file from `FallCohort` to the `WinterCohort` folder
  mv Italo.txt../ FallCohort/

6. Oh no, our entire Winter Cohort had to be cancelled because of a worldwide pandemic :  
 We decided to bump all of the scheduled winter students to spring. In the `Bootcamp` directory create a copy of the `WinterCohort` folder called `SpringCohort`
  cp -r WinterCohort springCohort

7. Please rename the WinterCohort folder to `WinterCohortCANCELLED`
  mv WinterCohort/ WinterCohortCANCELLED/

8. Oh no! We're going out of business. Please delete the entire `Bootcamp` directory 
  mkdir Bootcamp
