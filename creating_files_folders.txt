and modifies date to the current.
  
file : Is used to identify the type of a file
    file filename

How does file detect the file type?
   file content + metadata
        It examines the content of the file, not the name or extension.
        Linux uses a system called magic numbers / magic bytes — special signatures inside files that help identify what they are.

File names -
Use lowercase
Avoid spaces — use _ or -
Start with letters
Avoid special symbols (! @ # $ % & * ? > < | / \)
Meaningful names only

Rules:
GOOD  -> clean, safe, no spaces, uses a-z 0-9 _ -
BAD   -> works but inconvenient (spaces, too many dots, $, ?, uppercase confusion)
UGLY  -> unsafe, may break shell or scripts (/ * > < | &, starts with -, null char)
