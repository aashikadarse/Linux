Locate:
--------
 Performs a search of pathnames accross our machine that match a given substring and 
 then prints out any matching names.

 eg: locate Mon

 Locate options:
-----------------
 -e: will only print entries that actually exist at the time locate is run

 -i: option tells locate to ignore casing

 -l or --limit : option will limit the number of entries that locate retrieves.

Sometimes locate shows files that you have deleted, because it relies on an older database.
To fix this: sudo updatedb
This refreshes the database with your current filesystem.


find: 
-----
By default ,find on its own will list every single file and directory nested in our current
      working directory
     
     we can also provide specific folder.
     eg: find friends/
         would print all the files and directories inside the friends directory(including nested folders)

finding by type  - find [path] -type [type_flag]
--------------
we can tell find to only find by file type:
only print files,directories,symbolic links, etc using the -type option

find -type f : will limit the search to files
find . -type f -- ( . ) current folder

find -type d : will limit the search to directories

finding by  name - 
---------------
we can provide a specific pattern for find to use when matching filename and
directories with the -name option 
we need to enclose our pattern in quotes

find ~/desktop -name "*.txt" -to find all files on our desktop that end in the .txt

finding by size
----------------
we can use the -size option to find files of a specific size.
For example, to find all files larger than 1 GB 
we could run by ----  find -size +1G 

To find all files that are exactly 20KB 
we can run ----- find -size 20K 

To find all the files that are under 50MB
we can run ----- find -size -50M 

finding by owner
----------------
we can use the -user option to match files and directories that belong to a 
particular user.

find ~ -user kitty

finding empty files/folders
-------------------
find -empty

find -empty -type f

HOW TIMESTAMPS WORK
--------------------
mtime - modification time, is when a file was last modified .whne its contents last changed.

ctime - change time,is when a file was last changed.This occur anytime mtime changes but also 
        when we rename a file ,move it or alter permissions

atime - access time , is updated when a file is ready by an application or a command like cat

eg: touch last_week -d "1 week ago"
    here we are changing the date of file to 1 week back

Command	                      Meaning
find . -mtime -1	      Modified in last 1 day
find . -mtime +7	      Modified more than 7 days ago
find . -ctime -2	      Permissions or metadata changed in last 2 days
find . -atime -3	      Accessed (read) in last 3 days
find . -mtime -90         Modified within 3 months
find . -mmin -5           Modified in the last 5 minutes
find /home -amin -30      Accessed within 30 min
find /home -mmin -30      Modified within 30 min
find /home -cmin -30      Metadata changed within 30 min

Find with logical operators
---------------------------
we can use the -and ,-or,-and -not operators to create more complex queries


User - Defined Actions:
-----------------------
we can provide find with our own action to perform using each pathname
Normally, find just locates files.
But user-defined actions let you decide what to do with each file that matches — like deleting, copying, moving, counting lines, etc.
exec 
----
Executes the command silently for all matches
find -exec command {};

find ~ -type f -empty -exec ls -l {} ;

ok
--
Prompts before executing each command — safer for destructive actions like rm
find -empty -ok rm '{}' ';'

xargs
-----
takes input (usually from another command’s output) and converts it into arguments for another command.
It’s often used when commands don’t accept input from standard input (stdin) directly.

command1 | xargs command2
→ This means “take the output of command1 and use it as input for command2

Deleting files listed by find
find . -type f -name "*.log" | xargs rm


Meaning:
find finds all .log files.
xargs rm deletes them one by one.

Equivalent to:
rm file1.log file2.log file3.log ...

eg:echo hello world | xargs mkdir 

eg: find -name "chapter[1-4].txt" | xargs cat > fullbook.txt
    this example finds four indicidual chapter files
    chapter1,chapter2,chapter3 and  chapter4 ,then passes
    them to the cat command ,which then outputs the
    combined contents to a file called fullbook.txt
