# Making Files And Folders Exercise

To get some practice creating files and folders from the command-line, 
we'll be creating a standard React project file structure.  D
on't worry at all if you don't know React, we're just making a bunch of empty files and folders!  

Your folder structure should now look like this:

```bash
my-app/
  README.md
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    index.css
    index.js
```
1. Create a new folder called `my-app`
   mkdir my-app

2. Navigate to `my-app` and inside create two new empty files called `README.md` and `package.json`
   cd my-app
   touch README.md and package.json

3. Still inside of `my-app` create a new folder called `public`. Without `cd`-ing into `public`, create an `index.html` file inside of it.
   mkdir public
   touch public/index.html

4. Create a new folder called `src` inside of `my-app`.  Navigate inside of it.
   cd ..
   mkdir src
   cd src
5. Using a single line, create the following four files inside of `src`: `App.css`, `App.js`, `index.css`, and `index.js`
    touch App.css App.js index.css index.js


Using a single command, create a new directory inside of `src` called `components`, 
and inside of that new `components` directory create a new directory called `Navbar`.  
Do this using a single command, without first creating the `components` directory.


Your folder structure would now look like this:

```bash
my-app/
  README.md
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
  src/
		**components/
			Navbar/**
    App.css
    App.js
    index.css
    index.js
```

mkdir -p components/Navbar
