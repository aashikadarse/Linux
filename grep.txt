Grep:
-----
This command searches for patterns in each files's contents.
Will print each line that matches a pattern we provide

example : grep "chicken" animals.txt will print each line from 
         the animals.txt file that contains the pattern "chicken" 


Word Search :
------------
the -w option to ensure that grep only matches words,
rather than fragments located inside of other words.

eg:grep -w "cat" book.txt
   grep -w "cat" book.txt would match cat but not cather

Recursive Search
----------------
use the -r option to perform a recursive search which will include all files under
a directory,subdirectories and their files ,and so on.

if we don't specify a starting directory grep will search the current working directory 
test

eg: grep -ri "name" filename/

Grep options:
-------------

-c :counts in how many lines that word had occured .
eg: grep "happy" grepcount.txt - c

-w: matches "I" as a whole word only 
this prevents matches inside other words like "IN" or "FIRE"

Option	           Meaning	                                           Example	                                       Output Description
-A NUM	After – shows the match line + NUM lines after	     grep -A 2 "happy" file.txt	             If "happy" is on line 5, shows lines 5, 6, 7
-B NUM	Before – shows the match line + NUM lines before	  grep -B 3 "happy" file.txt	             If "happy" is on line 5, shows lines 2, 3, 4, 5
-C NUM	Context – shows the match line + NUM lines before 	  grep -C 2 "happy" file.txt	             If "happy" is on line 5, shows lines 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
                   and after


-n → Show line numbers
Adds line numbers before each matching line.
Eg:
grep -n "Happiness" practice.txt
Example output:
2:Happiness comes in small moments, like a smile from a stranger.
2: → this line number in the file.


-m NUM → Stop after NUM matches
Tells grep to stop searching after it finds a certain number of matches.
eg:
grep -m 2 "happy" practice.txt

Explanation:
"happy" → the pattern to search
-m 2 → stop after 2 matching lines are found

Regex : we can provide regular expressions to grep. 
------  Regular expressions help us match complex patterns,but the sytax does differ.

.    - matches any single character
      eg: grep 'p...' songsofmyself.txt 

^    - mathces the start of a line
       eg: grep "^I" songsofmyself.txt -w

$    - matches the end of  a line
       eg: grep ')$' songsofmyself.txt 
 
[abc]- matches any character in the set 
       eg: grep 'a[1-6]' songsofmyself.txt 

[^abc]-matches any char NOT in set
       It just looks for at least one character that is NOT a, b, or c.

[A-Z]- matches characters in a range
       grep "[A-Z]" example.txt
  
*    -repeat previous expression 0 or more times
      grep "lo*" example.txt

\    -escape meta-characters
     grep "2\.5" example.txt
     Explanation:
                 . is normally a wildcard in regex (matches any character).
                 \. → escape it to match a literal dot.
                 So 2\.5 matches the string 2.5 exactly.

-E → extended regular expressions
--------------------------------
     Enables extended regex, so you can use ?, +, |, () without escaping.

Normally in basic grep, ? would need \? to be recognized.
 birds? → the regex itself

In extended regex:

? → means “the preceding character 0 or 1 times”


So birds? matches:

bird  → because 's' occurs 0 times  
birds → because 's' occurs 1 time

Summary of the command
grep "birds?" -wE filename.txt


Search in filename.txt

Match whole words (-w)

Use extended regex (-E)

Pattern: bird or birds (the s is optional)


{} in regex
------------
In extended regex (-E), curly braces {} are used for repetition counts, not character sets.

Example: a{2} → matches exactly two as (aa)

a{1,3} → matches 1 to 3 as (a, aa, or aaa)

Piping to grep:
---------------
A common use case is to use grep to whittle down or filter a large chunk of data.

eg:ps -aux | grep hermione
   In this example the ps -aux command will output a huge list of all processes running on our 
   machine.We pipe that data to grep and then filter it down to only the processes that "hermione"
