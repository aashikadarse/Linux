Grep:
-----
This command searches for patterns in each files's contents.
Will print each line that matches a pattern we provide

example : grep "chicken" animals.txt will print each line from 
         the animals.txt file that contains the pattern "chicken" 


Word Search :
------------
the -w option to ensure that grep only matches words,
rather than fragments located inside of other words.

eg:grep -w "cat" book.txt
   grep -w "cat" book.txt would match cat but not cather

Recursive Search
----------------
use the -r option to perform a ecursive search which will include all files under
a directory,subdirectories and their files ,and so on.

if we don't specify a starting directory grep will search the cuurent working directory
