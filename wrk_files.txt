cat:Will read the contents of a file and print them out 
   cat <filename>

If we provide cat with multiple files,it will concatenate their 
contents and output them.
cat <file1> <file2> 
 -- will output file1 first and immediately after print the contents of files2

less:command displays the content of a file,one page at a time
     we can navigate forward and backwards through the file.
     less <filename>

     Open less with line numbers
     Research → option is -N or --LINE-NUMBERS.
    Open file with line numbers:
    eg:less -N poem.txt
  
tac :will concatenate and print files in reverse.
     it prints each line of a file, starting with the last line .
     you can think of it as printing in reverse "vertically".
             first line
     file -> second line
             third line

    tac file.txt  ->third line
                    second line
                    first line

rev :prints the contents of a file, reversing the order of each line 
     rev file.txt
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
head:The head command prints a portion of a file starting from the beginning of the file.
     By default it prints the first 10 line of a file
     head filename.txt

head contd:we can specify a number of lines for head to print using the -n option (or --lines)
     head -n 13 filename.txt

head contd contd:we can also provide a number of bytes to print out rather than lines using the -c option
                 head -c 8 filename.txt

tail:The tail command prints a portion of a file from the ending of the file.
     By default it prints the last 10 line of a file
     tail filename.txt

tail contd:we can specify a number of lines for tail to print using the -n option (or --lines)
     tail -n 10 filename.txt
     tail -13 filename.txt also works 

tail -f :Is a very useful Linux command for live monitoring a file.

What tail -f does?
tail -f shows the last lines of a file and keeps watching it for new updates.
It is commonly used to watch log files in real time.
tail -f filename 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wc: word count -- wc filename
  command can tell us the number of words,lines or bytes in files.
  by default it prints out three numbers: lines
                                          words
                                          bytes

we can use the  -l option to limit the output of the number of lines
                -w option to limit the output to the number of words in the file
                -c option to limit the output to the number of characters in the file
                -m  option to limit the output to the number of bytes in the file
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sort: the sort command outputs the sorted contents of a file .
      By default ,it will sort the lines of a file alphabetically
      sort filename.txt

 --numeric-sort :-n 
   sort -n filename

-nr :reverse numeric sort
    sort -nr filename

-u :sort unique value only ignores the duplicates
    sort -u filename

Advanced sorting by Field:
     we can specify a particular "column" that we want to sort by 
     using the -k opation followed by a field number

     sort data.txt -nk 2  - in this example it tells sort to use the 
     numeric sort and to sort using the 2nd fiels 

     eg: pencil 0.50          pencil 0.50
         flower 9.99  -->     pie 4.99
         pie 4.99             flower 9.99
