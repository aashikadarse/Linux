What is an Operating System (OS)?
      An Operating System (OS) is the main system software that manages computer hardware and 
     provides an interface for users and applications to interact with the machine.
Why OS?:
          To run applications (browser, games, terminal, etc.)
          To communicate with hardware
          To keep the system secure and stable
          To manage files & multitasking

UNIX - UNiplexed Information Computing System              
  
  Unix is a multitasking, multi-user operating system developed in the 1970s at AT&T's Bell Labs. 
  It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, and is widely used in servers, workstations.

Unix wasn’t the first OS.
Before Unix, there were other operating systems like GM-NAA I/O, CTSS, and MULTICS.

Unix became popular because it was:

✔️ Portable (written in C)
✔️ Multi-user & multi-tasking
✔️ Simple and modular design
✔️ The base for Linux, macOS, Android concepts


What are Unix-like Systems?
       operating systems that behave like Unix, follow its design principles, 
       and often use similar commands — but are not the original Unix.
       Examples:
               Linux, macOS, BSD, and Solaris.

Linux: Linux is not the full OS—it is the kernel.
       When we add programs, libraries, and tools around the Linux kernel, 
       we get a Linux Operating System (Ubuntu, Kali, Fedora, etc.)

Linux = Core engine
Ubuntu/Kali = Full OS built on Linux kernel


Kernel: The core part of the operating system
        Controls hardware and system resources
        Manages CPU, Memory, Disk, Devices
        Does not interact directly with the user

Kernel = Brain / Engine of the system

Shell: A command interpreter
       Takes commands from the user and sends them to the kernel
       Converts human commands → machine instructions
       Examples: Bash, Zsh, Sh, Fish

Shell = Translator / Interface between user & kernel



Terminal: A program (window) where you type commands
         It runs the shell inside it

Terminal = Screen/Chatbox to talk to the shell

User
 ↓
Terminal (App to type commands)
 ↓
Shell (Interprets your commands)
 ↓
Linux Kernel (Controls hardware)
 ↓
Hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk, Devices)
